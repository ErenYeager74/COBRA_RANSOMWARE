## Description

Cobra ransomware is a ransomware programmed and devoted to researchers and educational institutes to provide students with investigations on the source code of the malware and how it operates. Hoping that further research will lead to a successful solution to totally mitigate ransomware. <br />
##### Every block is explained in the code itself

#### Technologies

- Python

## What is a Ransomware

Ransomware is software that encrypts data to demand a ransom in exchange for the victim to access their encrypted data. The crucial information of a user or an organisation is encrypted to prevent access to files, databases, or software. Then access is requested for a ransom. Ransomware frequently aims to target database and file servers and move across a network, so it can quickly shut down an entire company. It is an expanding threat that results in billions of dollars in payments to hackers as well as major losses and costs for commercial and governmental entities. (Trellix, n.d)
The asymmetric encryption is used by ransomware. A pair of keys are used in this type of cryptography to both encrypt and decrypt a file. The attacker generates a unique public-private key pair for the victim, with the private key which is kept in the attacker's server being used to decrypt files   After the victim pays the ransom, the attacker releases the victim's private key. (Gavin O’Gorman & Geoff McDonald, 2012).
Having ransomware software infect a machine is not enough. A server must be contacted by the ransomware to obtain an encryption key and report its findings. This calls for a server run by a business that will overlook criminal activities and ensure the attackers' privacy. These web hosts go by the name Bulletproof Hosting. The majority are in China or Russia. To further conceal their own IP addresses, attackers also employ proxies or VPN services. (Ronny Richardson & Max M. North, 2017)

## How To Use
In the encrypt script add your own local ip address in line #125

In server script add your own local ip address in line #4


#### Installation
```
$ pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
Run the auto-py-to-exe
```
$ auto-py-to-exe
```
Convert the py encrypt to one file exe <br />

Repeat with py decrypt <br />

Convert the py code to exe (the server should be running on compiler every time the user want to execute the ransomware.
